              Hi, I'm Sean the web developer. I'm okay with React, but I have a
              lot to learn and have a great time doing it. Let's get in touch,
              we'll build something, play video games, or whatever.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default About;
